this extension is for collecting data from websites and send it to the server, this data can be images, videos and text.

## how it works

first you have to activate the extension by clicking on the icon in the toolbar and be sure the extension has a small text says ON, then select what you want and it will appear a plus icon to the top of your selection when you click on it a popup will appear that has two fields the first one is the key name of the data and the second is the data it self, when you enter the proper values click on

I have an idea that says if i gonna have to collect image or video i have to click right on it and then click on add to my collection in the popup menu 

I have two thoughs about the send button the first one is show
